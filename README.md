# SmartandMultitaskingHelmet

## Overview
The Smart and Multitasking Helmet is a hardware project aimed at enhancing the safety of motorcyclists on the road. Given the rising number of motorcycle accidents and fatalities, particularly in India, this project strives to mitigate risks by introducing advanced safety features integrated into a smart helmet.

## Key Features
- **Enhanced Safety:** Equipped with various sensors and features such as fall detection, accident recognition, position monitoring, and alcohol detection to improve rider safety.
- **Intelligent Functionality:** Functions as a smart device with features like automatic ignition control, ensuring the motorcycle cannot start unless the helmet is worn.
- **Real-time Alerts:** Sends real-time notifications to emergency services or the rider's family in case of an accident or emergency, providing precise GPS location details.

## Project Objectives
1. **Reduce Accident Fatalities:** Aim for a projected 30% reduction in motorcycle accident fatalities to significantly enhance rider safety on the roads.
2. **Incorporate Advanced Technology:** Leverage sensors, microcontrollers, and wireless communication modules to integrate cutting-edge technology into motorcycle safety gear.
3. **Promote Road Safety Awareness:** Beyond hardware implementation, raise awareness about road safety and the importance of protective gear among motorcyclists.
